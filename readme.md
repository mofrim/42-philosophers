# 42's Philosophers Project

Installation is as easy as it gets: `git clone ...` and `make` in either `philo` or
`philo_bonus` dir.

I also made a quick writeup of the "math" behind the Philosophers Problem. You
can find it in the [https://github.com/mofrim/42-philosophers/blob/main/philo_math.pdf](philo_math.pdf).

Also i included my modified version of [https://github.com/rom98759](Romain's)
fantastic Philosophers Visualizer.
